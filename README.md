# Indian Rainfall Trends Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Indian rainfall data using R and Plotly. The analysis is performed on a dataset sourced from the Open Government Data Portal of India. The dataset provides historical rainfall data for every subdivision in India from the year 1901 to 2017. The primary focus of this study is to analyze the rainfall trends of the last 50 years.

## Analysis Highlights

### 1. Average Rainfall Over Last 50 Years

- Investigated the average rainfall on a yearly basis for the last 50 years.
- Identified the year with the maximum and minimum average rainfall.
- Explored trends in India's average rainfall over the past 50 years.

### 2. Subdivision-wise Rainfall Averages

- Analyzed the average annual rainfall for different subdivisions over the last 50 years.
- Identified the subdivision with the highest and lowest average rainfall.

### 3. Seasonal Rainfall Analysis

- Examined the average rainfall for different seasons (JF, MAM, JJAS, OND) in India.
- Visualized the variation in seasonal rainfall.

### 4. Seasonal Rainfall Distribution Across Subdivisions

- Studied the distribution of seasonal rainfall across subdivisions.
- Utilized box plots to show the variation in rainfall for different seasons and subdivisions.

### 5. Subdivision-wise Analysis: Jan-Feb Rainfall

- Focused on the average rainfall during the months of January and February.
- Analyzed variation in rainfall across subdivisions.

### 6. Subdivision-wise Analysis: Jun-Sep Rainfall

- Explored the average rainfall during the monsoon months of June to September.
- Investigated differences in rainfall between subdivisions.

### 7. Average Monthly Rainfall

- Investigated the average monthly rainfall distribution across all months.
- Highlighted the months with the maximum and minimum average rainfall.

### 8. Monthly Rainfall Variability in Subdivisions

- Examined the variability of monthly rainfall in Indian subdivisions using box plots.

### 9. Coastal Karnataka Rainfall Analysis

- Focused on monthly rainfall patterns in the Coastal Karnataka subdivision.
- Analyzed variations and identified extreme values.

### 10. West Rajasthan Rainfall Analysis

- Investigated monthly rainfall patterns in the West Rajasthan subdivision.
- Examined extreme values and seasonal trends.

### 11. Tamil Nadu Rainfall Analysis

- Explored the monthly rainfall patterns in the Tamil Nadu subdivision.
- Studied variations and trends in different months.
